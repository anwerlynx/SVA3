Build a fully professional multi-institute university website using Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript.

The project represents "Valley Higher Institutes" which includes two completely separated institutes:

1) Higher Institute of Management, Finance & Information Systems
2) Higher Institute of Engineering & Technology

Each institute must function like a semi-independent entity with:

- Its own homepage
- Its own news system
- Its own quality assurance section
- Its own departments
- Its own library section
- Its own announcements
- Its own visual identity accent (subtle variation in color tone)

Use modern professional stack:

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript

Styling:
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS variables for design system
- Clean spacing system (8pt grid)

UI Components:
- shadcn/ui
- Radix UI primitives

Icons:
- Lucide React (consistent academic style)

Animations:
- Framer Motion
- Smooth scroll reveal animations
- Fade-up on section enter
